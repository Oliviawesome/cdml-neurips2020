# Data Generating Process to Evaluate Causal Discovery Techniques for Time Series Data
This repository captures source code and data sets for our paper "Data Generating Process to Evaluate Causal Discovery Techniques for Time Series Data" at the Causal Discovery &amp; Causality-Inspired Machine Learning Workshop at Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2020.

## Usage

The code was developed and tested using Python 3.7.8. The required Python packages and their versions are provided in `requirements.txt`. After cloning the repository locally, create a virtual environment by running the following commands:
```
python3 -m venv <env_name>
source <env_name>/bin/activate
pip install -r <path_to_local_repo>/requirements.txt
deactivate
```

An example script, as well as the sythentic data sets generated for the experiments in the paper, will be made public before the workshop on 11 December 2020.
